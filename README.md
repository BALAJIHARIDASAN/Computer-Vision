Computer vision (CV) is the scientific field which defines how machines interpret the meaning of images and videos. Computer vision algorithms analyze certain criteria in images and videos, and then apply interpretations to predictive or decision making tasks.

Today, deep learning techniques are most commonly used for computer vision. This article explores different ways you can use deep learning for computer vision. In particular, you will learn about the advantages of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which provide a multi-layered architecture that allows neural networks to focus on the most relevant features in the image.
